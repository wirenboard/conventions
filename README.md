## Wiren Board MQTT Conventions

The basic abstractions are *devices* and their *controls*. 

Each *device* has some *controls* assigned to it, i.e. parameters that can be controlled or monitored.
*Devices* and *controls* are identified by names, which are generally arbitrary strings.

Starting from 2024, WirenBoard has established the following rules for naming MQTT topics for new devices and their controls:
- The topic name cannot include punctuation, brackets, or special characters such as %$#& etc.
- For a new device, the topic name should not contain more than four words and numbers. Write each word in lowercase and separate them with underscores.
- For a new version of an existing device, make the topics compatible with the old pattern (marked as deprecated). The names of new topics should be styled identically to the existing topics.

Examples:
- Good: `/devices/room_light/meta`
- Bad: `/devices/Room-Light#1/meta`
- Old: `/devices/RoomLight/meta` - not recommended for new topics

The metadata is published exclusively in the `*/meta` topics and their subtopics.
Metadata messages are published on device startup with `retained` flag set.
For example, some room lighting control *device* with one input (for wall switch) and one output (for controlling the lamp) *controls* is represented with MQTT topics as following:

* `/devices/RoomLight/meta` - JSON with all meta information about *device*
* `/devices/RoomLight/meta/error` - device-level error state, non-null means there was an error (usable as Last Will and Testament)
* `/devices/RoomLight/controls/Lamp` - contains current lamp state, '0' = off, '1' = on
* `/devices/RoomLight/controls/Lamp/on` - send a message with this topic and payload of '0'/'1' to turn lamp off or on
* `/devices/RoomLight/controls/Lamp/meta` - JSON with all meta information about control
* `/devices/RoomLight/controls/Switch` - contains current wall switch state
* `/devices/RoomLight/controls/Switch/meta` - JSON with all meta information about control
* `/devices/RoomLight/controls/Switch/meta/error` - non-null value means there was an error reading or writing the control. In this case  `/devices/RoomLight/controls/Switch` contains last known good value.

Each *device* usually represents the single physical device or one of the integrated peripheral of a complex physical device, although there are some boundary cases where the distinction is not clear. The small and not-so-complex real-world devices (say, wireless weather sensor) are ought to be represented by a single *device* in the MQTT hierarchy. 
Each *device* must be handled by a single driver or publisher, though it's not enforced in any way.

The *Conventions* are based on [HomA MQTT Conventions](https://github.com/binarybucks/homA/wiki/Conventions). The main changes are: no configuration is stored in MQTT (as MQTT is not so good as a database) and the *control* types system is more developed and complicated.

### Device's `/meta` topic

The topic contains all meta information in one JSON

```jsonc
{
    "driver": DRIVER_NAME,     // The name of a driver publishing the device
    "title": {
        "en": DEVICE_TITLE,    // English title of the device
        "ru": DEVICE_TITLE_RU, // Russian title of the device
        ...
    }
}
```
English title could be published in `/devices/+/meta/name` for backward compatibility with old conventions.


### Controls's `/meta` topic

The topic contains all meta information in one JSON

```jsonc
{
    // Control's type
    "type": "value",

    // Units. ASCII string. Could be set only for type "value". No units by default
    "units": "W",

    // Maximum allowed control's value. Default value for range type is 10^9, for other types no limit specified by default
    "max": 100,

    // Minimum allowed control's value. Default value for range type is 0, for other types no limit specified by default
    "min": -100.1,

    // Control's value is rounded to defined precision by a driver and it is also used during user input validation
    // If no precision is present, the value is used as-is
    "precision": 0.1,

    // Display order in user interface
    "order": 10,

    // The control doesn't have /on topic. Default value is false
    "readonly": true,

    "title": {
        "en": CONTROL_TITLE,    // English title of the control
        "ru": CONTROL_TITLE_RU, // Russian title of the control
        ...
    }

    // Enum titles for control's value. Could be set for type "value" and "text".
    // In case of type "value", each key in "enum" should be a stringified number, specified in either decimal or hexadecimal format.
    "enum": {
        "0": {
            "en": ENUM_TITLE,
            "ru": ENUM_TITLE_RU,
            ...
        },
        "1": {
            "en": ENUM_TITLE,
            "ru": ENUM_TITLE_RU,
            ...
        },
        ...
    }
}
```

`type`, `min`, `max`, `order`, `readonly` could be published as subtopics of `/devices/+/controls/+/meta` for backward compatibility with old conventions.

### Control Types

#### Switch
A control that toggles it's value when pressed by the user.
* Meta topic value: switch
* Possible values: 0 or 1

#### Alarm
A control that indicates whether an alarm is active.
* Meta topic value: alarm
* Possible values: 0 or 1

#### Push button
A stateless push button
* Meta topic value: pushbutton
* Possible values: 1
* Messages may lack retained flag

#### Range
A range slider that takes integer values between 0 and any other integer that is greater 1
* Meta topic value: range
* Possible values: min - max
* Default max: 255
* Default min: 0
Different values can be set by publishing an arbitrary integer that is in range from ```min``` to ```max```.

#### RGB color control
R/W control for color
* Meta topic value: rgb
* Possible values: "R;G;B", i.e. three semicolon-delimited numbers.
The numbers itself must be integers between 0 and 255.

#### Text
A control that displays a value as text.
* Meta topic value: text
* Possible values: Anything

#### Generic value type control

A control for a arbitrary value.

* Meta type value: value
* Possible values: float
Different values can be set by publishing an arbitrary float that is in range from ```min``` to ```max```.
Precision could be specified in ```precision``` property. The value is rounded to defined precision by a driver and it is also used by `wb-mqtt-homeui` during user input validation.

#### Specific value type controls

:warning: **WARNING**: These control types are deprecated. It is recommended to use `units` property instead.
